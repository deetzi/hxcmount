Welcome to HxCmount.

This little program allows you to use your Floppy Emulator as an
software Hard Disk Emulator.

The 'Hard Disk' is actually an image file named "IMG*.IMA" on the root
of your SDcard.

You can now specify an image file name by renaming the .PRG to .TTP.
The filename needs to be correctly padded with spaces without the "." 
included
eg. IMGC.IMA becomes IMGC    IMA

If for example you enter IMGC it will search for IMGC*.IMA.
