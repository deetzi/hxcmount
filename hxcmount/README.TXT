Welcome to HxCmount.

This little program allows you to use your HxC Floppy Emulator as an
software Hard Disk Emulator.

The 'Hard Disk' is actually an image file named "IMG*.IMA" on the root
of your SDcard.

Warning: after launching hxcmount.prg, do not try to use the floppy
disk. It would reset the HxC card to floppy mode and you would not
be able to return to hard disk mode. You will have to reset your ST.
